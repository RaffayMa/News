## Github Workflow

 - Repo Setup : 
 1. main
 2. news_front-end  
 3. news_back-end

 The code will be pushed to the concerned branched until completion, when completed the merge proceducre will be as followed: 
  When frontend/backend code is stable and ready to “ship”:

On GitHub → open Pull Request:

frontend → main (for frontend changes)

backend → main (for backend changes)

Review changes → Merge.

Update local main.

main stays clean as the combined “final product”.
